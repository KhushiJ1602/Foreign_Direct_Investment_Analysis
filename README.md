# Foreign_Direct_Investment_Analysis

### *AIM*

The aim of this project is to analyze sector-wise Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India from 2011-12 to 2022-23 to uncover key trends and factors influencing FDI inflows. The study will develop and evaluate forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost to predict future FDI trends, comparing their accuracy using metrics like R², MSE, and MAE. Additionally, sectors will be segmented using K-Means Clustering to provide strategic insights, and the predictive accuracy of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors will be compared to identify the most reliable model for forecasting FDI. The findings aim to support policymakers and investors in making informed decisions to enhance FDI inflows into India.
