# Foreign_Direct_Investment_Analysis

### *AIM*

The aim of this project is to analyze sector-wise Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India from 2011-12 to 2022-23 to uncover key trends and factors influencing FDI inflows. The study will develop and evaluate forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost to predict future FDI trends, comparing their accuracy using metrics like R², MSE, and MAE. Additionally, sectors will be segmented using K-Means Clustering to provide strategic insights, and the predictive accuracy of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors will be compared to identify the most reliable model for forecasting FDI. The findings aim to support policymakers and investors in making informed decisions to enhance FDI inflows into India.

### *OBJECTIVES*

1. **Historical Data Analysis**: Analyze sector-wise FDI data in India from 2011-12 to 2022-23, identifying trends, seasonal variations, and key factors influencing FDI inflows across industries.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct in-depth EDA to uncover patterns, trends, anomalies, and outliers in the FDI data, providing a solid foundation for predictive modeling.

3. **Development of Predictive Models**: Build and evaluate time series forecasting models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost, to accurately predict future sector-specific FDI trends.

4. **Model Performance Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the forecasting models using metrics such as MSE, R², and MAE to identify the most accurate and reliable model.

5. **Sector Clustering**: Apply K-Means Clustering to classify sectors based on cumulative FDI values, identifying high, moderate, and low investment clusters for strategic decision-making.

6. **Machine Learning Model Assessment**: Evaluate and compare the predictive accuracy of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors in forecasting historical cumulative FDI, determining which model best captures the underlying trends.
7. 
8. **Actionable Insights and Recommendations**: Provide strategic recommendations for policymakers and industry leaders to attract and enhance FDI inflows, based on insights from model evaluations and cluster analysis.
